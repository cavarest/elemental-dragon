## Operator Setup

### Becoming an Operator

Before you can use admin commands, you must be configured as an operator.

#### Docker Development Environment

If using the provided Docker setup, operators are configured automatically:

1. **Default Operator**: The username `posiflow` is automatically configured as an operator (defined in `.env`)

2. **Add More Operators**: Edit the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   OFFLINE_OPS=posiflow,player2,admin3
   ```

3. **Restart Server**:
   ```bash
   ./stop-server.sh
   ./start-server.sh
   ```

#### Production Server (Non-Docker)

For production servers, use the standard Minecraft operator commands:

1. **In-Game**: `/op <username>`

2. **Server Console**:
   ```bash
   # Stop the server
   # Edit ops.json directly
   {
     "uuid": "player-uuid",
     "name": "username",
     "level": 4,
     "bypassesPlayerLimit": false
   }
   ```

3. **Using itzg/minecraft-server** (non-offline mode):
   ```bash
   # Set OPS environment variable
   OPS=username1,username2
   ```

### Verify Operator Status

Check if you're an operator:

```bash
# In-game
/op list  # Shows all operators

# RCON
docker exec -it papermc-elementaldragon rcon-cli
> op list

# Check ops.json
docker exec papermc-elementaldragon cat /data/ops.json
```

### Troubleshooting Operator Issues

If you cannot run admin commands:

1. **Verify you're listed as operator**: `/op list`
2. **Check username case-sensitive**: `Posiflow` ≠ `posiflow`
3. **Restart server after adding operator**: `docker-compose restart`
4. **Check ops.json exists**: See [Docker Deployment Guide](/admin/docker/) for details

## Give Commands

### Give Items
**Syntax**: `/ed give <player-ref> <type> <element-kind>`

**Parameters**:
- `<player-ref>`: Player selector (@p, @s, @a) or player name
- `<type>`: `ingredients` or `equipment`
- `<element-kind>`: `fire`, `agile`, `immortal`, or `corrupt`

**Examples**:
```
/ed give @p equipment fire          # Give Burning Fragment to nearest player
/ed give PlayerName ingredients agile # Give Agility Fragment crafting materials
/ed give @a equipment immortal      # Give Immortal Fragment to all players
```

**⚠️ Important - One-Fragment Limit**:
Players can only carry **one fragment at a time**. When you use this command:
- If the player already has a fragment in their inventory, they **cannot pick up** the new fragment
- The fragment will be dropped on the ground
- The player must drop their existing fragment first (press Q key)
- The player will see: `⚠ You can only carry one fragment at a time!`

**What Gets Given**:

**Equipment**:
- The specified fragment item

**Ingredients**:
- Heavy Core (1x) - now a **vanilla Minecraft item** found in Ancient Cities
- All materials needed to craft the fragment
- Complete ingredient set for immediate crafting

**Note**: Heavy Core is a vanilla Minecraft item found in Ancient City chests. Players no longer need to craft Heavy Core - they can find it directly in the world or receive it from admins.

## Set Fragment Command

### Equip Player Fragment
**Syntax**: `/ed setfragment <player-ref> <element>`

Equip a fragment for a player.

**⚠️ Important - One-Fragment Limit**:
Players can only carry **one fragment at a time**. This command will **fail** if the player already has a fragment equipped.

**Error Messages**:
- If player already has a fragment: `⚠ You can only carry one fragment at a time!`
- Player will see: `Drop your [Fragment] before equipping the [New Fragment].`
- Player will see: `Your fragment abilities have been withdrawn.` (if they ran `/withdrawability` first)

**Recommended Workflow for Operators**:
1. Check player's current fragment: `/ed status <player>`
2. If player has a fragment equipped:
   - Ask player to use `/withdrawability` to remove abilities
   - Ask player to drop their fragment (press Q)
3. Then use `/ed setfragment <player> <element>`

**Parameters**:
- `<player-ref>`: Player selector or name
- `<element>`: `fire`, `agile`, `immortal`, or `corrupt`

**Examples**:
```
/ed status @p                      # Check if player has fragment equipped
/ed setfragment @p immortal        # Equip Immortal Fragment (if player has no fragment)
```

**Use Case**: Quickly equip a fragment for a player who has no fragment equipped.

**Alternative - Give Command**:
If you want to give a player a fragment item (which they can then pick up):
```
/ed give @p equipment immortal
```
This will give the player the fragment item, but they still need to drop any existing fragment first before picking it up.

## Info Commands

### Fragment Info
**Syntax**: `/ed info <element>`

Displays detailed information about a fragment including abilities, cooldowns, and passive bonuses.

/ed info corrupt                      # Show Corrupted Core info
/ed info lightning                    # Show Lightning Strike info
```

### Player Status
**Syntax**: `/ed status <player-ref>`

Shows player's equipped fragment and cooldown states.

**Parameters**:
- `<player-ref>`: Player selector or name

**Examples**:
```
/ed status @p                         # Show nearest player's status
/ed status PlayerName                 # Show PlayerName's status
