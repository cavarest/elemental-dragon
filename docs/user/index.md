# User Guide

Welcome to the Elemental Dragon plugin user guide. This section covers everything players need to know about using the plugin.

## What is Elemental Dragon?

Elemental Dragon is a PaperMC plugin that introduces powerful elemental abilities through dragon eggs and fragments. Players hold these items in their offhand to unlock unique abilities:

- **Dragon Egg**: Lightning strike ability (classic feature)
- **Elemental Fragments**: Four elements (Fire, Wind, Earth, Void) with dual abilities each

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Server administrators can [install the plugin](installation/) in minutes
2. **Getting Items**: Use commands or crafting recipes to obtain dragon eggs and fragments
3. **Equip Items**: Hold dragon eggs or fragments in your offhand
4. **Activate Abilities**: Use commands to trigger powerful elemental attacks

## Contents

- [Installation Guide](installation/) - Server setup and configuration
- [Fragments Guide](fragments/) - All fragment abilities and how to use them

## Core Concepts

### Offhand Activation

All abilities require holding the appropriate item (dragon egg or fragment) in your **offhand**. This design choice:

- Keeps your main hand free for combat and building
- Allows quick ability switching by changing offhand items
- Provides clear visual feedback of available abilities

### Cooldown System

Each ability has a balanced cooldown to prevent spam:

- Lightning: 10 seconds
- Fragment abilities: 15-45 seconds depending on power
- Cooldowns persist across logout and death
- Server operators can adjust cooldowns globally

### Elemental Fragments

Four complete element sets are available:

| Element | Fragment Item | Abilities |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Fire | Burning Fragment (Blaze Powder) | Dragon's Wrath, Infernal Dominion |
| Wind | Agility Fragment (Feather) | Draconic Surge, Wing Burst |
| Earth | Immortal Fragment (Totem) | Draconic Reflex, Essence Rebirth |
| Void | Corrupted Core (Nether Star) | Dread Gaze, Life Devourer |
